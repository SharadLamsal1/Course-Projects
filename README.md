A portfolio of class projects I completed during my Masters degree. 
| Project Title                        | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| Crash Detection from Traffic Images | Built a supervised image classification system to detect traffic crashes using CNN, SVM, Random Forest, and k-NN. Preprocessed and augmented a dataset of traffic scene images, then trained and evaluated models using TensorFlow and OpenCV. Achieved 94% accuracy with CNN and evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and confusion matrix. |
