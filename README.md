# Course-Projects
A portfolio of class projects I completed during my Masters degree. 
| Project Title                        | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| Crash Detection from Traffic Images | Built machine learning models (CNN, SVM, Random Forest, k-NN) to classify traffic images as crash or non-crash. Used Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and scikit-learn for image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Applied data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness. The CNN model achieved 94% accuracy, outperforming traditional models (SVM: 85%, RF: 88%). Evaluated models using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure balanced performance. |
| ACC & CACC Simulation in Mixed Traffic | Simulated mixed traffic platoons of human-driven and connected automated vehicles (CAVs) using MATLAB Simulink to assess ACC and CACC strategies. Examined impacts of market penetration rates and connectivity on acceleration, headway, fuel consumption, and stability. Results showed up to 14.8% improvement in fuel efficiency and reduced spacing variability with higher CACC adoption. |
| Charlottesville Parking Policy Analysis | Modeled the impacts of increasing UVA permits and public parking in Charlottesville using TransCAD and a regional travel demand model. Evaluated scenarios based on VMT, VHT, total emissions, and delay. Results showed VMT and delay reduction in most TAZs, but a slight increase in emissions due to higher vehicular activity. |
| GIS-Based Transit Accessibility – Petersburg | Conducted spatial analysis in ArcGIS Pro to assess public access to food and green spaces in Petersburg, VA. Designed and optimized trolley routes using Remix and routing algorithms (TSP, VRP) in Python. Accessibility improved by 370% for green space and 488% for food locations in high-need census blocks. |
| VDOT Crash Trends Dashboard | Developed an interactive dashboard using Python, Dash, Plotly, and PostgreSQL to analyze 1M+ crash records from the VDOT Open API. Built automated data pipelines and integrated filters by city, year, lighting, weather, and road type. Identified urban crash hotspots and trends linked to adverse conditions. Deployed on Azure with real-time data capability. |
| Trip Generation Analysis (NHTS Data) | Analyzed household travel behavior using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and developed multiple linear regression models in R to predict daily person trips per household. Included predictors such as household income, number of workers, vehicles, and household size. Performed feature selection using stepwise regression and tested for multicollinearity using VIF. Conducted diagnostic checks using residual plots and QQ plots to validate model assumptions. Found household income and worker count to be the most significant predictors. Final model had an Adjusted R² of 0.38, indicating moderate explanatory power for trip generation behavior. |
